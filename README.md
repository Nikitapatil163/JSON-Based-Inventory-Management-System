# JSON-Based-Inventory-Management-System
This is an Inventory Management System Project using JSON. Here, I have used dictionary to store a record data and that data is converted into record.json file.
In record I have added Product_id, Product_name, Product_category, Product_unit, Product_quantity and Product_price.
I have created two different files one for "Adding New Items" into record and another for "Purchasing the Product".
For adding new items I imported JSON and dumps the json file to convert data into string format. Then added the new product items into the dictionary.
For purchasing products I imported JSON and loads the json file to read data into dictionary format. Then write the code for what items have to purchase then update that inventory after purchase.
Then create sales.json file to to store data of what items have purchased.This is the overview of project.
